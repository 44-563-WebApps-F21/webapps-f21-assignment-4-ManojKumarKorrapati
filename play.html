        <p class="scene">SCENE_The Picture Gallery at Hunstanton_. _Door at back leading on to
        terrace_.</p>

        <p class="stage directions">[LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C. LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a
        sofa_. GERALD _in a chair_.]</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4>
        <p class="speach">Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald. I
        knew she would come round in the end.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know
        she doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary. She is
        perfectly right, too. I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I
        couldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value
        whatsoever. If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is
        not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Don’t be afraid, Gerald. Remember that you’ve got on
        your side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth! There is nothing
        like youth. The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life. The old are in
        life’s lumber-room. But youth is the Lord of Life. Youth has a kingdom
        waiting for it. Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,
        like most kings. To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I
        wouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of
        the community.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">So Lady Hunstanton told me.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.
        I sometimes think she must have married beneath her.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="stage directions">[_Winces slightly_.] Really? [_Goes over and puts
        his hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.] </p>
        <p class="speach"> have missed not having a father,
        I suppose, Gerald?</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me. No one ever had such
        a mother as I have had.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I am quite sure of that. Still I should imagine that
        most mothers don’t quite understand their sons. Don’t realise, I mean,
        that a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.
        After all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such
        a hole as Wrockley, could you?</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Oh, no! It would be dreadful!</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">A mother’s love is very touching, of course, but it is
        often curiously selfish. I mean, there is a good deal of selfishness in
        it.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="stage directions">[_Slowly_.] </p>
        <p class="speach"> I suppose there is.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Your mother is a thoroughly good woman. But good
        women have such limited views of life, their horizon is so small, their
        interests are so petty, aren’t they?</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">They are awfully interested, certainly, in things we don’t care
        much about.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I suppose your mother is very religious, and that sort
        of thing.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Oh, yes, she’s always going to church.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Ah! she is not modern, and to be modern is the only
        thing worth being nowadays. You want to be modern, don’t you, Gerald?
        You want to know life as it really is. Not to be put off with any
        old-fashioned theories about life. Well, what you have to do at present
        is simply to fit yourself for the best society. A man who can dominate a
        London dinner-table can dominate the world. The future belongs to the
        dandy. It is the exquisites who are going to rule.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I should like to wear nice things awfully, but I have always
        been told that a man should not think too much about his clothes.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">People nowadays are so absolutely superficial that
        they don’t understand the philosophy of the superficial. By the way,
        Gerald, you should learn how to tie your tie better. Sentiment is all
        very well for the button-hole. But the essential thing for a necktie is
        style. A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="stage directions">[_Laughing_.]</p> 
        <p class="speach"> I might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord
        Illingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do. I don’t know
        how to talk.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to
        every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you
        will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">But it is very difficult to get into society isn’t it?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either
        to feed people, amuse people, or shock people—that is all!</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">To be in it is merely a bore. But to be out of it
        simply a tragedy. Society is a necessary thing. No man has any real
        success in this world unless he has got women to back him, and women rule
        society. If you have not got women on your side you are quite over. You
        might just as well be a barrister, or a stockbroker, or a journalist at
        once.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">It is very difficult to understand women, is it not?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">You should never try to understand them. Women are
        pictures. Men are problems. If you want to know what a woman really
        means—which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do—look at her,
        don’t listen to her.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">But women are awfully clever, aren’t they?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">One should always tell them so. But, to the
        philosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the triumph of matter over
        mind—just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">How then can women have so much power as you say they have?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">The history of women is the history of the worst form
        of tyranny the world has ever known. The tyranny of the weak over the
        strong. It is the only tyranny that lasts.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">But haven’t women got a refining influence?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Nothing refines but the intellect.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Still, there are many different kinds of women, aren’t there?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Only two kinds in society: the plain and the coloured.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">But there are good women in society, aren’t there?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Far too many.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">But do you think women shouldn’t be good?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">One should never tell them so, they’d all become good
        at once. Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex. Every woman is a rebel,
        and usually in wild revolt against herself.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">You have never been married, Lord Illingworth, have you?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Men marry because they are tired; women because they
        are curious. Both are disappointed.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">But don’t you think one can be happy when one is married?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Perfectly happy. But the happiness of a married man,
        my dear Gerald, depends on the people he has not married.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">But if one is in love?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">One should always be in love. That is the reason one
        should never marry.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Love is a very wonderful thing, isn’t it?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself.
        And one ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a
        romance. But a really _grande passion_ is comparatively rare nowadays.
        It is the privilege of people who have nothing to do. That is the one
        use of the idle classes in a country, and the only possible explanation
        of us Harfords.</p>

        <h4 class="gerald">GERALD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Harfords, Lord Illingworth?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">That is my family name. You should study the Peerage,
        Gerald. It is the one book a young man about town should know
        thoroughly, and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever
        done. And now, Gerald, you are going into a perfectly new life with me,
        and I want you to know how to live. [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _appears on terrace
        behind_.] For the world has been made by fools that wise men should live
        in it!</p>

        <p class="stage directions">[_Enter_ L.C. LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ DR. DAUBENY.]</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Ah! here you are, dear Lord Illingworth. Well, I
        suppose you have been telling our young friend, Gerald, what his new
        duties are to be, and giving him a great deal of good advice over a
        pleasant cigarette.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I have been giving him the best of advice, Lady
        Hunstanton, and the best of cigarettes.</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I am so sorry I was not here to listen to you, but I
        suppose I am too old now to learn. Except from you, dear Archdeacon,
        when you are in your nice pulpit. But then I always know what you are
        going to say, so I don’t feel alarmed. [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.] Ah!
        dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, do come and join us. Come, dear.</p>
        <p class="stage directions"> [_Enter_ MRS.
        ARBUTHNOT.] Gerald has been having such a long talk with Lord
        Illingworth; I am sure you must feel very much flattered at the pleasant
        way in which everything has turned out for him. Let us sit down. [_They
        sit down_.] And how is your beautiful embroidery going on?</p>

        <h4 class="arbuthnot">MRS. ARBUTHNOT</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I am always at work, Lady Hunstanton.</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Mrs. Daubeny embroiders a little, too, doesn’t she?</p>

        <h4 class="archdeacon">THE ARCHDEACON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">She was very deft with her needle once, quite a Dorcas.
        But the gout has crippled her fingers a good deal. She has not touched
        the tambour frame for nine or ten years. But she has many other
        amusements. She is very much interested in her own health.</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Ah! that is always a nice distraction, in it not? Now,
        what are you talking about, Lord Illingworth? Do tell us.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I was on the point of explaining to Gerald that the
        world has always laughed at its own tragedies, that being the only way in
        which it has been able to bear them. And that, consequently, whatever
        the world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things.</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Now I am quite out of my depth. I usually am when Lord
        Illingworth says anything. And the Humane Society is most careless.
        They never rescue me. I am left to sink. I have a dim idea, dear Lord
        Illingworth, that you are always on the side of the sinners, and I know I
        always try to be on the side of the saints, but that is as far as I get.
        And after all, it may be merely the fancy of a drowning person.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">The only difference between the saint and the sinner
        is that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Ah! that quite does for me. I haven’t a word to say.
        You and I, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, are behind the age. We can’t follow Lord
        Illingworth. Too much care was taken with our education, I am afraid.
        To have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays. It shuts one
        out from so much.</p>

        <h4 class="arbuthnot">MRS. ARBUTHNOT</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I should be sorry to follow Lord Illingworth in any of
        his opinions.</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">You are quite right, dear.</p>

        <p class="stage directions">[GERALD _shrugs his shoulders and looks irritably over at his mother_.
        _Enter_ LADY CAROLINE.]</p>

        <h4 class="caroline">LADY CAROLINE</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Jane, have you seen John anywhere?</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">You needn’t be anxious about him, dear. He is with
        Lady Stutfield; I saw them some time ago, in the Yellow Drawing-room.
        They seem quite happy together. You are not going, Caroline? Pray sit
        down.</p>

        <h4 class="caroline">LADY CAROLINE</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I think I had better look after John.</p>

        <p class="stage directions">[_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">t doesn’t do to pay men so much attention. And
        Caroline has really nothing to be anxious about. Lady Stutfield is very
        sympathetic. She is just as sympathetic about one thing as she is about
        another. A beautiful nature.</p>

        <p class="stage directions">[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]</p>

        <p class="speach">Ah! here is Sir John! And with Mrs. Allonby too! I suppose it was Mrs.
        Allonby I saw him with. Sir John, Caroline has been looking everywhere
        for you.</p>

        <h4 class="allonby">MRS. ALLONBY</h4> 
        <p class="speach">We have been waiting for her in the Music-room, dear Lady
        Hunstanton.</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Ah! the Music-room, of course. I thought it was the
        Yellow Drawing-room, my memory is getting so defective. [_To the_
        ARCHDEACON.] Mrs. Daubeny has a wonderful memory, hasn’t she?</p>

        <h4 class="archdeacon">THE ARCHDEACON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">She used to be quite remarkable for her memory, but
        since her last attack she recalls chiefly the events of her early
        childhood. But she finds great pleasure in such retrospections, great
        pleasure.</p>

        <p class="stage directions">[_Enter_ LADY STUTFIELD _and_ MR. KELVIL.]</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Ah! dear Lady Stutfield! and what has Mr. Kelvil been
        talking to you about?</p>

        <h4 class="stutfield">LADY STUTFIELD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">About Bimetallism, as well as I remember.</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Bimetallism! Is that quite a nice subject? However, I
        know people discuss everything very freely nowadays. What did Sir John
        talk to you about, dear Mrs. Allonby?</p>

        <h4 class="allonby">MRS. ALLONBY</h4> 
        <p class="speach">About Patagonia.</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Really? What a remote topic! But very improving, I
        have no doubt.</p>

        <h4 class="allonby">MRS. ALLONBY</h4> 
        <p class="speach">He has been most interesting on the subject of Patagonia.
        Savages seem to have quite the same views as cultured people on almost
        all subjects. They are excessively advanced.</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">What do they do?</p>

        <h4 class="allonby">MRS. ALLONBY</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Apparently everything.</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Well, it is very gratifying, dear Archdeacon, is it
        not, to find that Human Nature is permanently one.—On the whole, the
        world is the same world, is it not?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">The world is simply divided into two classes—those who
        believe the incredible, like the public—and those who do the improbable</p>

        <h4 class="allonby">MRS. ALLONBY</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Like yourself?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Yes; I am always astonishing myself. It is the only
        thing that makes life worth living.</p>

        <h4 class="stutfield">LADY STUTFIELD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">And what have you been doing lately that astonishes you?</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I have been discovering all kinds of beautiful
        qualities in my own nature.</p>

        <h4 class="allonby">MRS. ALLONBY</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Ah! don’t become quite perfect all at once. Do it
        gradually!</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I don’t intend to grow perfect at all. At least, I
        hope I shan’t. It would be most inconvenient. Women love us for our
        defects. If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything,
        even our gigantic intellects.</p>

        <h4 class="allonby">MRS. ALLONBY</h4> 
        <p class="speach">It is premature to ask us to forgive analysis. We forgive
        adoration; that is quite as much as should be expected from us.</p>

        <p class="speach">Ah! we women should forgive everything, shouldn’t we,
        dear Mrs. Arbuthnot? I am sure you agree with me in that.</p>

        <h4 class="arbuthnot">MRS. ARBUTHNOT</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I do not, Lady Hunstanton. I think there are many
        things women should never forgive.</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">What sort of things?</p>

        <h4 class="arbuthnot">MRS. ARBUTHNOT</h4> 
        <p class="speach">The ruin of another woman’s life.</p>

        <p class="stage directions">[_Moves slowly away to back of stage_.]</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Ah! those things are very sad, no doubt, but I believe
        there are admirable homes where people of that kind are looked after and
        reformed, and I think on the whole that the secret of life is to take
        things very, very easily.</p>

        <h4 class="allonby">MRS. ALLONBY</h4> 
        <p class="speach">The secret of life is never to have an emotion that is
        unbecoming.</p>

        <h4 class="stutfield">LADY STUTFIELD</h4> 
        <p class="speach">The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of
        being terribly, terribly deceived.</p>

        <h4 class="kelvil">KELVIL</h4> 
        <p class="speach">The secret of life is to resist temptation, Lady Stutfield.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">There is no secret of life. Life’s aim, if it has
        one, is simply to be always looking for temptations. There are not
        nearly enough. I sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a
        single one. It is quite dreadful. It makes one so nervous about the
        future.</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="stage directions">[_Shakes her fan at him_.] </p>
            <p class="speach">I don’t know how it is,
        dear Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems to me
        excessively immoral. It has been most interesting, listening to you.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4>
        <p class="speach">All thought is immoral. Its very essence is
        destruction. If you think of anything, you kill it. Nothing survives
        being thought of.</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I don’t understand a word, Lord Illingworth. But I
        have no doubt it is all quite true. Personally, I have very little to
        reproach myself with, on the score of thinking. I don’t believe in women
        thinking too much. Women should think in moderation, as they should do
        all things in moderation.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">Moderation is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton. Nothing
        succeeds like excess.</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">I hope I shall remember that. It sounds an admirable
        maxim. But I’m beginning to forget everything. It’s a great misfortune.</p>

        <h4 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h4> 
        <p class="speach">It is one of your most fascinating qualities, Lady
        Hunstanton. No woman should have a memory. Memory in a woman is the
        beginning of dowdiness. One can always tell from a woman’s bonnet
        whether she has got a memory or not.</p>

        <h4 class="hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON</h4> 
        <p class="speach">How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth. You
        always find out that one’s most glaring fault is one’s most important
        virtue. You have the most comforting views of life.</p>
