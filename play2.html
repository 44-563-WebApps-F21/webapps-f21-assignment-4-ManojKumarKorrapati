    <p class="speach archdeacon">I am afraid I must go, Lady Hunstanton.
        Tuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny’s bad nights.</p>

    <p class="speach hunstanton">Well, I won’t keep you from her. [_Goes
        with him towards door_.] I have told Farquhar to put a brace of
        partridge into the carriage. Mrs. Daubeny may fancy them.</p>

    <h4 class="name">THE ARCHDEACON</h4>
    <p class="speach archdeacon">It is very kind of you, but Mrs. Daubeny never touches
        solids now. Lives entirely on jellies. But she is wonderfully cheerful,
        wonderfully cheerful. She has nothing to complain of.</p>
